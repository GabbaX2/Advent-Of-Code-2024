# Advent of Code - 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve programming puzzles to unlock new challenges every day, starting from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents a new problem that increases in difficulty, and the goal is to complete all the puzzles.

This year, I'm attempting the challenges using **Python** as my programming language of choice.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The main language used to solve the problems.
- **Libraries**: Any additional libraries I may use throughout the challenges will be mentioned in the individual problem solutions (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.).
