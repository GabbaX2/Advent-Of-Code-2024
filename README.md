Ecco un esempio di README.md per la tua repository di “Advent of Code”, dove spieghi che stai affrontando le sfide utilizzando Python:

# Advent of Code - 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve programming puzzles to unlock new challenges every day, starting from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents a new problem that increases in difficulty, and the goal is to complete all the puzzles.

This year, I'm attempting the challenges using **Python** as my programming language of choice.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: The main language used to solve the problems.
- **Libraries**: Any additional libraries I may use throughout the challenges will be mentioned in the individual problem solutions (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.).

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2024.git

	2.	Navigate to the folder where the repository is located:

cd advent-of-code-2024


	3.	Install any required dependencies (if necessary):

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Each day’s solution can be found in its respective folder (e.g., day1.py, day2.py, etc.).
	5.	Run the solution for a specific day:

python day1.py
